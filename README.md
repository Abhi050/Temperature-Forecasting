Project Description:

This project focused on the analysis and forecasting of temperature data in a weather dataset using time series techniques. The primary goal was to develop accurate models for predicting temperature values based on historical data.

The project involved several steps and methodologies, including data preprocessing, stationarity analysis, feature selection, model training, and order estimation. The following tools and languages were used throughout the project:

Python: The project leveraged Python as the primary programming language for data manipulation, analysis, and model implementation. Python offers a wide range of libraries and packages specifically designed for time series analysis, making it a suitable choice for this project.

Pandas: Pandas, a powerful data manipulation library in Python, was used for handling and processing the dataset. It provided efficient tools for handling missing values, converting categorical features, and performing various data transformations.

NumPy: NumPy, a fundamental library for scientific computing in Python, played a crucial role in mathematical operations and array manipulations. It provided essential functionalities for data processing and calculations.

Statsmodels: Statsmodels, a Python library for statistical modeling, was utilized for implementing various time series models such as SARIMA and ARIMA. It offered comprehensive functionalities for model estimation, diagnostics, and forecasting.

Matplotlib and Seaborn: Matplotlib and Seaborn, Python libraries for data visualization, were employed to create informative and visually appealing graphs and plots. These libraries facilitated the exploration and presentation of the data patterns, trends, and model performance.

scikit-learn: scikit-learn, a versatile machine learning library in Python, was used for feature selection using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). It provided efficient implementations of various feature selection techniques and offered a seamless integration with other libraries.

The project incorporated a systematic approach to address various aspects of time series analysis, including data preprocessing, stationarity testing, model selection, and evaluation. By leveraging these tools and techniques, the project aimed to provide valuable insights into temperature forecasting and contribute to the field of weather analysis.
Note: The list of tools and libraries mentioned above is not exhaustive, and additional packages and tools may have been used depending on the specific requirements and objectives of the project.
